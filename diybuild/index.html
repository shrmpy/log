The server hardware is your choice. See <a href=https://dlaa.me/blog/post/skyhole>@DavidAns' Sky-Hole article</a> for a virtual machine installation. If you haven't experienced the Raspi, my recommendation is to get one. It can even be the Zero as described in this <a href=https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-hole-ad-blocker-with-pi-zero-w/overview-adafruit2>Adafruit guide</a>.</li></ol><h3 class="f4 is-4">Step 2 /OS</h3><ol start=2><li>Now that you've obtained your Raspi, it needs the OS. Most often, this is Raspbian. If it didn't ship together with your Raspi, it's easy enough to <a href=https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/>download</a>. The alternative is purely a personal choice. I wanted to have a bare <a href=https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi>Ubuntu Server</a> that doesn't include the desktop, and window manager pre-installed.</li></ol><h3 class="f4 is-4">Step 3 /Net</h3><ol start=3><li>Once you've completed the OS installation, your first step
<sup>1</sup>
should be an update. With Raspbian, your network link will work "out of the box". So proceed to</li></ol><pre><code data-astro-raw><span>sudo</span> <span>apt</span> update <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>sudo</span> <span>apt</span> full-upgrade</code></pre><p>If you went the Ubuntu Server route, the wifi requires manual setup. Determine the wireless interface first:</p><pre><code>ip a</code></pre><p>For me, this returned a list that included <code>wlan0</code> which is the wireless interface. You'll need it to modify the <code>/etc/netplan/wireless.yaml</code> config file:</p><pre><code data-astro-raw><span>sudo</span> <span>cp</span> /usr/share/doc/netplan/examples/wireless.yaml /etc/netplan/
<span>sudo</span> <span>nano</span> /etc/netplan/wireless.yaml</code></pre><p>The example content should resemble:</p><pre><code data-astro-raw>network:
version: 2
renderer: networkd
wifis:
wlp2s0b1:
dhcp4: no
dhcp6: no
addresses: [192.168.0.21/24]
gateway4: 192.168.0.1
nameservers:
addresses: [192.168.0.1, 8.8.8.8]
access-points:
"network_ssid_name":
password: "**********"
</code></pre>The highlighted line 5 is where the wireless interface value goes. Note that there are other lines that need to change, too. We stay with the Pi-hole requirement of static
<sup>2</sup>
addressing. So lines 6 and 7 are fine as
<code>no</code>
. Line 8 must be changed to the IP that you reserve for the Raspi's wireless interface. In our diagram, we label it as
<code>192.168.0.2</code>
. Line 11 should be fine for now, but we'll come back after Unbound is running. Lastly, the access point fields are required, and specific to your wifi router. Exit and save the changes. Now we'll bring up the network:<pre><code data-astro-raw><span>sudo</span> netplan --debug try</code></pre><p>If there are no errors, we can continue:</p><pre><code data-astro-raw><span>sudo</span> netplan --debug generate
<span>sudo</span> netplan --debug apply</code></pre><p>With the network connected, we can proceed to the system update</p><pre><code data-astro-raw><span>sudo</span> <span>apt</span> update <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>sudo</span> <span>apt</span> full-upgrade</code></pre><p>::: danger 1
As a rule, the first step should be to harden the system. See <a href=https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/security.html>Ubuntu guide</a> for a start, but at the minimum enable the firewall (i.e., <code>sudo ufw enable</code>). To allow other devices access to Unbound DNS, a port 53 rule will need to be created.
:::</p><p>::: tip 2
To reserve an IP to use for a static address, you'll want to go into your wifi router's DHCP settings. Reserving the IP is also good to avoid accidental assignments by your DHCP service.
:::</p><h3 class="f4 is-4">Step 4 /Unbound</h3><ol start=4><li>Here we depart a little from stock Pi-hole setup. Instead of Dnsmasq, we opt for Unbound. Unbound supports the blocking of domains just like Dnsmasq, while also giving us the ability to do recursive DNS. Use the steps from the <a href=https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound/#setting-up-pi-hole-as-a-recursive-dns-server-solution>recursive DNS guide</a> which weâ€™ll reproduce here:</li></ol><pre><code data-astro-raw><span>sudo</span> <span>apt</span> <span>install</span> -y unbound
<span>curl</span> -o root.hints https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root

<span>sudo</span> <span>nano</span> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf</code></pre><p>With the file contents:</p><pre><code data-astro-raw>server:

<sup>3</sup>
:</li></ol><pre><code data-astro-raw><span>curl</span> -o unbound.bl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oznu/dns-zone-blacklist/master/unbound/unbound.blacklist
<span>sudo</span> <span>mv</span> unbound.bl /etc/unbound/</code></pre><p>Now start Unbound DNS:</p><pre><code data-astro-raw><span>sudo</span> <span>service</span> unbound start</code></pre><p>::: tip 3
For convenience, this domain list comes ready to go by <a href=https://github.com/oznu/dns-zone-blacklist>Oznu</a>. Based on this project, I made a <a href=https://gitlab.com/rtmi/sinkhole>version in Golang</a> adjusting for zone redirects according to <a href=https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/>Unbound man page</a>.
:::</p><h3 class="f4 is-4">Step 6 /Resolver</h3><ol start=6><li>Switch resolved from exporting queries now that Unbound is running.</li></ol><pre><code data-astro-raw><span>sudo</span> systemctl stop systemd-resolved
<span>sudo</span> <span>nano</span> /etc/systemd/resolved.conf</code></pre><p>Which contains the <code>DNSStubListener</code> setting. Uncomment it and assign <code>no</code>. This will stop it from port 53 conflicts.</p><pre><code data-astro-raw>[Resolve]

#MulticastDNS=no
#DNSSEC=no
#DNSOverTLS=no
#Cache=yes

#ReadEtcHosts=yes</code></pre><p>Exit and save changes.</p><p>Go back and revisit netplan wireless configuration. On this pass, we can change the nameservers:</p><pre><code data-astro-raw><span>sudo</span> <span>nano</span> /etc/netplan/wireless.yaml</code></pre><p>With content that resembles:</p><pre><code data-astro-raw>network:

<span>sudo</span> netplan --debug generate
<span>sudo</span> netplan --debug apply
<span>sudo</span> <span>reboot</span></code></pre><p>Then link the active resolver configuration file:</p><pre><code data-astro-raw><span>sudo</span> <span>ln</span> -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf</code></pre><p>Done. Your own personal DNS sinkhole appliance in a Raspi. Pointing your DHCP setting for DNS at your Raspi should stop ads from loading on web pages.</p></div></body></html>
