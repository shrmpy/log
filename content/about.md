# About
These journal entries are to help my future self remember odds and ends.

## § DIY
Gemini by design encourages the client implementation to be done in ~100 LOC. It is asking folks to build it. We are in a time of starting over, "going back to school", and that's alright.

---

## * Notes, Lessons, Monologue
* Source the guides, "Here is the short list of articles that help configure X:"
* Mainly as a journal entry, try to avoid repeating information, but explain notes from the guides where there was something specific required.
